This program reads binary values from a JSON input, decodes them based on a specified base, and uses Lagrange interpolation to estimate a value based on the given data points. The result is printed as an integer. The program demonstrates the integration of JSON parsing, numerical conversion, and mathematical interpolation—all common tasks in data processing and computation.

This program reads binary values from a JSON input, decodes them based on a specified base, and uses Lagrange interpolation to estimate a value based on the given data points. The result is printed as an integer. The program demonstrates the integration of JSON parsing, numerical conversion, and mathematical interpolationâ€”all common tasks in data processing and computation.
